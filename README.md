### Hi!

I'm Giacomo, a junior full-stack developer.

After 8 years in Sales, I decided to make a career change and learn programming to build cool stuff.

I graduated from a one-year **JavaScript / React developer** program at OpenClassrooms.

Currently, I am doing an apprenticeship as a junior back-end developer at MyBeezBox, while also enrolled in a two-year **Python / Django developer** program with OpenClassrooms.

Feel free to visit my [portfolio](https://giacomo-llinares.com/) and say hi! :wave:
