### Hi!

I'm Giacomo, a junior full-stack developer.

After 8 years in *Sales*, I've decided to learn programming and build cool stuff.

I graduated from OpenClassroom's **JavaScript / React developer** 1 year program.

I'm about to start 2 years of apprenticeship as a junior back-end developer at MyBeezBox, along with OpenClassroom's **Python / Django developer** 2 years program.

Feel free to visit my [portfolio](https://giacomo-llinares.com/) and say hi! :wave:
